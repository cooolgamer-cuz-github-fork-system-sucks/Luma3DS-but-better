*Noob-proof (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

## Todo and notes:

### What it is
**Luma3DS** is a program to patch the system software of (New) Nintendo (2)3DS handheld consoles "on the fly", adding features such as per-game language settings, debugging capabilities for developers, and removing restrictions enforced by Nintendo such as the region lock.

It also allows you to run unauthorized ("homebrew") content by removing signature checks.
To use it, you will need a console capable of running homebrew software on the Arm9 processor.

Since v8.0, Luma3DS has its own in-game menu, triggerable by <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd> (see the [release notes](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)).

### Changes with the official build
Note: most features are taken from [DullPointer's luma fork](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS) because the main goal of this build is updating DullPointer's fork to the latest luma version. There's also some features taken from other luma forks as well.

- Removed auto-copy to ctrnand
- Restored UNITINFO and enable rosalina on safe_firm options on the luma config menu (TWL patch option is now with "enable external firms and modules")
- Removed the need of having both "Game Patching" and "External Firms and Modules" enabled for patching sysmodules, just "External Firms and Modules" need to be enabled
- Added shortcuts:
  - Press start + select to toggle bottom screen (nice when you watch videos) inspired by [This](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/9fea831656446cbaa2b5b4f6364407bb1b35dee7)
  - Press A + B + X + Y + Start to instantly reboot the console. Useful in case of freeze, but can corrupt your sdcard. This is why this option is now hidden in the `config.ini` file
  - Press Start on Rosalina menu to toggle wifi -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/c1a20558bed3d792d54069719a898006af20ba85)
  - Press Select on Rosalina menu to toggle LEDs -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/fa70d374c00e39dee8b9ef54f60deb1da35a0c51) (and press Y to force blue led as a workaround when the battery is low)
- Added [Extra Config menu](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/174ed486ab59bd249488c9035682fa7d058d1e80) including:
  - Automatically suppress LEDs
  - Cut power to TWL Flashcards allowing to save battery
  - Home button opens Rosalina
  - start + select shortcut to toggle bottom screen (enabled by default)
- Improved system modules speed -> [Original](https://github.com/Core-2-Extreme/Luma3DS/commit/523b7f75d32e5795c67a16ecd45b28fe188bb08d)
- Added n3ds clock + L2 status in rosalina menu -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/2dbfa8b5c9b719b7f3056691f54332f42da6de8d)
- Added Software Volume Control -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/dc636d82492d1e87eb51785fa7f2a98617e7ece9)
- Added extended brightness presets and per-screen brightness -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/83e8d471a377bc6960fae00d6694f5fe86dcca42) WARNING: a little broken and can exceed the limits!
- Added permanent brightness calibration -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/0e67a667077f601680f74ddc10ef88a799a5a7ad)
- Added a option to cut wifi while in sleep mode allowing to save battery -> [Original](https://github.com/DullPointer/Luma3DS/commit/174ed486ab59bd249488c9035682fa7d058d1e80)
- Added the ability to redirect layeredFS path -> [Original](https://github.com/DeathChaos25/Luma3DS/commit/8f68d0a19d2ed80fb41bbe8499cb2b7b027e8a8c)
- Added loading of custom logo while launching a app from luma/logo.bin (Can't find the original commit...)
- Added loading of external decrypted otp from luma/otp.bin -> [Original](https://github.com/truedread/Luma3DS/commit/aa395a5910113b991e6ad7edc3415152be9bbb03#diff-ef6e6ba78a0250ac4b86068018f17d423fe816bb00fb3b550725f1cb6f983d29)
- Changed colors on config menu because why not
- Continue running after a errdisp error happens, this is the same option as instant reboot because they kinda go together (you decide when to reboot after an error occur)
- Added play coin maximize to rosalina menu -> [Original](https://github.com/Gruetzig/Luma3DS/commit/1e329b55dade61ba74a0bb1cc6e59d2504d0bde1)
